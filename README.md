## Overview
This project used a kaggle dataset of steam games review data to predict the helpfulness score of Steam reviews, represented by the
‘weighted_vote_score’, using various review-related features. Bucketizer, tokenizer, and minmaxscaler are used to do feature engineering.
Linear regression is used to build the models. 
The project's final goal is to evaluate the model's performance and understand the key
features influencing the helpfulness scores.
